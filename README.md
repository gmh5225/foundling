Script in batch to download program and then detect it as "anti-cheat"

I got this idea from 1 guy on youtube who made a CS2 prank. 

Original idea: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aQmGeeNVDVk ( in russian language)

Basically the whole idea was that the guy is "admin" on CS2 public and then he asks a guy for a cheat check on his pc and downloads a program, this one says anti-cheat and has some echo's to make it look as some cheap
anti-cheat.

You can change the link to programm and name in batch script so u can download whatever you want( i was just bored )
